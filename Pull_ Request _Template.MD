for pull request in covid strings 1
description: the purpose of this pull request is to bug fix covid strings 1 background .js due to the fact that I didn't initally know that I could just copy and paste the play cnavas file rather than to the risk and convert it to a json file and have it potentially disappear after 12 hours.
changes: copy and paste covid strings 1 background .js file on playcanvas to github 
edit covid strings 1 background.js and commit changes
