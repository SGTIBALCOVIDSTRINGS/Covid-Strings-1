# Security Policy
the secuirty policy for all covid strings versions is that in addition to encoruaging good cyber hygenie by our users we encoruage passwords to be diverse in characters meaning that we would ideally like passwords to have at least one capital letter 
a couple numbers in addition to lowercase letters
## Supported Versions
While 1 is currently in development I would like future versions to be able to have the same security software if possible.
Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

| Version | Supported   
|1 ------- | :x:------------------ |

| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |
2 and 3 have not reached this stage and thus don't even have a random  x or check mark to support it.
all security for a particular version extends to the  github files involving the background,first round,second round, championship and game code.
## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.
Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
You can report a vulernability in our security through our blue sky page as well as through our gmail account. When it comes to security updates It will be about every couple of months. This will ensure that there is a regular update of the apache node and playcanvas websites without worrying so much that the user
experience .
If the vulernability is accepted there will be a maintence period of anywhere from 2 to 5 days and if vulernability is declined then services will be able to continue operating as normal unless some new issue comes up.
